# Contributing

Want to add another support for a new format or/and usage? Add a new feature? Fix a bug?

1. Create a pull request with a branch like `feature/<nameofbranch>` or `hotfix/<nameofbranch>`.
2. Don't forget to explain the issue or the benefits of the feature you want to be merged.
3. Write unit tests covering the feature and/or fix the ones the feature/issue breaks.

And in any case feel free to ask for help in any of those steps.
